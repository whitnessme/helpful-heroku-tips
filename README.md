## Heroku Postgres Add-on
### To "drop database" / Reset:
Instead of removing the postgres add-on to completely wipe one's database, follow these instructions to drop all the data, leaving only the database.

1. **Click on the specific app you want to remove data and click on the *Resources* tab.**

*If you are using the starter that deploys to Heroku through Github actions, then you can just push as usual and it will migrate and seed for you.* 

## Useful Manual Console Commands
These are if you're **not** using the automatic Heroku deploy through Github actions. But can be useful if the Github actions aren't working as expected.
*(Pease put a question up in the question-channel if there's problems so TA's can figure out what's going on and provide tips for other students)*
